# js-expression

This library allows you to tokenize, parse and evaluate javascript expressions. No eval()!

*Although the library is functional, it is not ready for production*. But cheer up. I got this far in less than a week and I'm eager to finish it!


## Usage:

```javascript
let e = new Expression('(1+1)*3');
let result = e.evaluate();   // evaluates to 6
```

Functions can be added like this:

```javascript
let e = new Expression('add(2,4)');
e.addFunction('add', (a,b) => a+b);
let result = e.evaluate();   // evaluates to 6
```

## Supported operators:
',', '??', '||', '&&', '|', '^', '&', '==', '!=', '===', '<', '>', '<=', '>=', '>>', '<<', '>>>', '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '**', '!', '~'

## Unsupported (working on it)
- Accessing variables passed to evaluator
- Unary plus and minus, ie "-7" (**BEWARE**)
- Ternary operator '?'
- Member access, ie `obj.firstName`
- Computed member access, ie `obj['firstName']`
- Object constructors, ie {firstName: 'Bj√∏rn'}
- Array constructors, ie [1,2]

## Unsupported features (I am intendendly not going to implement these)
- operators that makes assignments (++, --, =, etc)
- function constructors
- new keyword
- Optional chaining [?.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)
- yield

## How it works
The library contains three engines, each in a class of its own, and a class pulling it together for convenience.

### Tokenizer
Converts a string to tokens. A token consists of type information and value.

*Examples:*

| in      | out               |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 7       | [LITERAL, 7]      |
| +       | [INFIX_OP, "+"]   |
| !       | [PREFIX_OP, "!"]  |

### Parser
The parser parses tokens into a rpn list ([reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)). Such a list is very suited for being evaluated.

*Examples:* (not showing the token types for simplicity)

| in      | out                 |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 7+1     | [7, 1, '+']         |
| 1+2*3   | [1, 2, 3, '*', '+'] |
| (1+2)*3 | [1, 2, +, '3', '*'] |

Note 1: actual input is tokens, not a string. For example it is [[LITERAL, 7], [INFIX_OP, "+"], [LITERAL, 1]] rather than "7+1"
Note 2: actual output is array of tokens, not array of string.


### Evaluator
The evaluator evaluates the tokens and operators in the rpn list.

*Examples:* (again, for simplicity, not showing token types)
| in           | out                 |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| [7, 1, '+']  | 8                   |

Note: actual input must be array of tokens, not array of string, as the example could lead you to think


### Expression
Pulls it all together. It takes care of parsing before evaluating and makes sure not to parse again upon subsequent evaluations (when variables are supported, it will not be necessary to do a reparse in order to reevaluate with new values)
